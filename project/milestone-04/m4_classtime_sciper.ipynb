    "In this notebook, you will do a research investigation of your chosen dataset in teams. You will begin by formally selecting your research question (task 0), then processing your data (task 1), creating a predictive model (task 2), and evaluating your model's results (task 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please upload your solved notebook to Moodle (under [Milestone 4 Submission](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/assign/view.php?id=1199557)) adding your team name in title, example: `m4-classtime-teamname.ipynb`. Please run all cells before submission so we can grade effectively.\n",

    "## Classtime Dataset\n",
    "[Classtime](https://www.classtime.com/en/) is a Swiss EdTech startup that complements in-class teaching with immediate feedback on studentsâ€™ level of understanding. Teachers create ClassTime sessions for their class, where each session consists of *n* questions and a reflection in the end. Each student is tracked by a **participant_id**, which is unique within a session and in some cases can be tracked over sessions using the **social_user_id**. We have 5 data tables from this startup:\n",
    "- *sessions* (meta information about session format, teacher)\n",
    "- *questions* (all questions asked across sessions)\n",
    "- *answers* (each row represents a student answer to a question)\n",
    "- *reflection_questions* (4 reflection questions available to ask students)\n",
    "- *reflection_answers* (each row represents a student answer to a reflection questions)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided access to the full dataset. You should provide arguments and justifications for all of your design decisions throughout this investigation. You can use your M3 responses as the basis for this discussion."
